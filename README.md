# RASPI5-MAIN

Raspberry Pi 5 home automation bridge. Runs as a systemd service (`mybot.service`)
and coordinates local sensors, ESP IoT devices, Firebase RTDB, Telegram, and InfluxDB.
Functionally identical to [RASPI4-MAIN](https://github.com/bs220975/RASPI4-MAIN) —
refer to that README for full architecture, MQTT topics, Firebase paths, module
reference, and troubleshooting. This file documents Pi5-specific details and changes.

## Pi5-Specific Configuration

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Pi 5 LAN IP | `192.168.1.108` |
| Pi 4 LAN IP | `192.168.1.122` |
| Hub VIP (Keepalived) | `192.168.1.100` |
| Device ID in Firebase | `RASPI-5` |
| MQTT client ID | `raspi5-bridge` (set in `config.py`) |
| Local API port | `5757` |
| Mosquitto broker | `192.168.1.108:1883` (Pi5 direct) |

All ESP device IPs and MQTT topics are identical to Pi4 — both Pis control the same
relays and sensors; only one holds the Keepalived VIP and actively receives ESP
MQTT connections at a time.

> **Note (2026-06-03):** `mybot.service` `MQTT_HOST` is `localhost` on both Pis.
> ESP devices still connect to the Keepalived VIP `192.168.1.100`, so only the MASTER
> Pi's broker has ESP clients — Pi5's mybot processes ESP MQTT only when Pi5 holds the VIP.
> Pi5 receives ESP32-RADAR motion events at all times via a mosquitto topic bridge
> (`OS_Migration_PI5/configs/mosquitto-radar-bridge.conf`) so Pi5's camera records
> independently regardless of MASTER/BACKUP state.

### Telegram Bot

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Bot username | `@raspi22bot` |
| Bot ID | `6525932255` |
| Chat ID | `5820747117` |
| Account name | `Raspi-5` |

Token and chat ID are set as defaults in `config.py` (`TelegramConfig`) and can be
overridden via `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` environment variables.

### Key Paths (on Pi5)

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/home/pi5/myenv/` | Python virtual environment |

## Dual-Pi Hub Architecture

Both Pi4 (`192.168.1.122`) and Pi5 (`192.168.1.108`) run `keepalived` VRRP and
`mybot.service` simultaneously. The virtual IP `192.168.1.100` floats between them
— only the MASTER Pi's mosquitto broker receives ESP device connections.

```
Pi4 (192.168.1.122) MASTER ─┐
                             ├── Keepalived VRRP ──► Hub IP 192.168.1.100
Pi5 (192.168.1.108) BACKUP ─┘                         │
                                                       └── Mosquitto broker
                                                           ESP devices connect here
```

**Priority:**
- Pi4 = 101 (always MASTER while keepalived is running), Pi5 = 100 (BACKUP)
- Pi4 reclaims VIP automatically after any restart
- Pi5 takes over only when Pi4's keepalived or wlan0 goes down

**keepalived is fully decoupled from mybot.service** — no `check_mybot` script,
no `notify_master/backup/fault` hooks. Keepalived manages only the VIP. Both Pis
run `mybot.service` independently under systemd at all times.

**MQTT isolation — no duplication:**
- Both Pis use `MQTT_HOST=localhost`
- When Pi4 is MASTER: ESP devices connect to VIP = Pi4's mosquitto. Pi4's mybot
  receives all ESP messages. Pi5's local mosquitto has no ESP clients → Pi5's mybot
  processes nothing.
- When Pi5 becomes MASTER: ESP devices reconnect to VIP = Pi5's mosquitto. Pi5's
  mybot automatically starts processing — no intervention needed.

**Pi5 radar bridge (always-on camera recording):**
Pi5's mosquitto bridges only the two ESP32-RADAR topics from the VIP broker, so
Pi5's camera records motion events and sends video to Pi5's Telegram regardless of
whether Pi5 is MASTER or BACKUP. Config:
`OS_Migration_PI5/configs/mosquitto-radar-bridge.conf` → deploy to
`/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/radar-bridge.conf` on Pi5.

**Split-brain prevention (Pi5):**
A systemd drop-in (`OS_Migration_PI5/keepalived/keepalived-wait-for-wlan.conf`)
delays Pi5's keepalived startup until wlan0 has its IP and is stable. Without this,
Pi5's wlan0 flaps ~4 s after boot, Pi5 misses Pi4's VRRP adverts, and both Pis
claim MASTER simultaneously. Deploy to
`/etc/systemd/system/keepalived.service.d/wait-for-wlan.conf` on Pi5.

**advert_int = 2 on both Pis** — extends `master_down_interval` to ~6.6 s,
giving extra tolerance for brief WiFi gaps before a BACKUP claims MASTER.

**WiFi power management must be disabled on both Pis:**
```bash
# Persistent — survives reboots (/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave-off.conf)
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 2
# Immediate
sudo iw dev wlan0 set power_save off
sudo nmcli con modify <SSID> 802-11-wireless.powersave 2
```

**Config files:**
- Pi5 keepalived: `OS_Migration_PI5/keepalived/keepalived.conf` → `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`
- Pi5 startup delay: `OS_Migration_PI5/keepalived/keepalived-wait-for-wlan.conf` → `/etc/systemd/system/keepalived.service.d/wait-for-wlan.conf`
- Pi5 radar bridge: `OS_Migration_PI5/configs/mosquitto-radar-bridge.conf` → `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/radar-bridge.conf`
- Pi4 keepalived: `RASPI4-MAIN/OS_Migration/keepalived/keepalived.conf` → `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf` on Pi4

```bash
# Check which Pi holds VIP
ip addr show wlan0 | grep 192.168.1.100

# Check keepalived state
sudo journalctl -u keepalived -n 20

# Check radar bridge is connected
sudo journalctl -u mosquitto | grep -i bridge
```

### VIP Handoff Commands (from `.bash_aliases`)

Run these from **Pi5** to transfer the active MASTER role between Pis. Both commands
print current status and ask for confirmation before acting.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `makepi5master` | Stop Pi4 keepalived → Pi5 claims VIP |
| `makepi4master` | Stop Pi5 keepalived → Pi4 claims VIP |

```bash
makepi5master   # Transfer VIP to Pi5 (run from Pi5)
makepi4master   # Transfer VIP to Pi4 (run from Pi5)
```

## Two-Floor Sensor & Relay Assignment

> **Reference note (2026-06-02):** The system spans two floors, each with its own Pi,
> radar sensor, and relay-controlled light. The sensor-to-relay wiring is different on
> each floor — this section is the canonical reference for which device does what and why.

### Pi4 — Lower Floor Lobby (RASPI4-MAIN)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Pi | Raspberry Pi 4 |
| IP | `192.168.1.122` |
| GitHub repo | `RASPI4-MAIN` |
| Floor | Lower lobby |
| Radar sensor | **LD2420** wired directly to Pi4 serial port (`/dev/serial0`, 115200 baud) |
| Relay device | **ESP01-LL-RLY** (`192.168.1.85`) — lower lobby light |
| MQTT relay topic | `home/esp01/lower-lobby/cmd/relay` |

**Motion flow (Pi4):**
```
LD2420 (serial /dev/serial0)
  └─► Pi4 reads radar frame in sensors.py
        └─► _process_motion() → _trigger_light_control()
              └─► MQTT ON → ESP01-LL-RLY (192.168.1.85) → lower lobby light ON
```

### Pi5 — Upper Floor Lobby (RASPI5-MAIN)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Pi | Raspberry Pi 5 |
| IP | `192.168.1.108` |
| GitHub repo | `RASPI5-MAIN` |
| Floor | Upper lobby |
| Radar sensor | **LD2420** wired to **ESP32-RADAR** (`192.168.1.87`) — NOT directly to Pi5 serial pins |
| Relay device | **ESP01-UL-RLY** (`192.168.1.111`) — upper lobby light |
| MQTT relay topic | `home/esp01/upper-lobby/cmd/relay` |
| MQTT motion topic | `home/esp32/radar2/motion` (published by ESP32-RADAR) |

**Why the radar is on the ESP32, not on Pi5:** The Pi5's `/dev/serial0` is the Bluetooth
UART and cannot be used for the LD2420. The LD2420 is instead wired to the ESP32-RADAR
board which publishes motion state over MQTT.

**All ESP devices use the Keepalived VIP `192.168.1.100` as their MQTT broker.** Whichever
Pi is MASTER holds the VIP and runs `mybot.service`. No firmware changes are needed when
Pi4 ↔ Pi5 failover occurs — all devices reconnect automatically to the same VIP on the
new MASTER.

**Motion flow (Pi5):**
```
LD2420 (wired to ESP32-RADAR at 192.168.1.87)
  └─► ESP32-RADAR publishes home/esp32/radar2/motion = ON
        └─► Pi5 MqttBridge._on_message() → _on_radar_motion()
              ├─► MQTT ON → ESP01-UL-RLY (192.168.1.111) → upper lobby light ON
              └─► MQTT ON → ESP01-LL-RLY (192.168.1.85)  → lower lobby light ON
                  (both lights respect 2-min manual-OFF override independently)
                  (both lights turn OFF 5 min after motion stops)
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / Fix |
|---|---|
| Porch/living-room light keeps toggling on by itself after user turns it off | Radar or LD2420 motion is still active while user manually turns light OFF — motion was firing auto-ON again; fixed in 2026-05-18: `_porch_manual_off_time` / `_living_room_manual_off_time` timestamps block auto-ON for 2 minutes after a manual OFF via app |
| Motion auto-ON takes 2–4 minutes to re-enable after manually toggling a light | Manual OFF sets the 2-min block timer but turning ON never cleared it; each OFF→ON→OFF cycle was resetting the timer to a fresh 2 minutes; fixed in 2026-05-20: `_execute_light_cmd` / `_execute_porch_cmd` now reset `_*_manual_off_time = 0` on explicit ON |
| Light switch in app does nothing | Check Firebase SSE streams started in log; check MQTT bridge connected to `192.168.1.108:1883` |
| Porch light not turning on at night | Check radar MQTT arriving (`home/esp32/radar2/motion`); check night hours 18–06; check `_porch_light_on` state |
| Radar motion detected but no video recorded | Check `is_video_recording_enabled()` via bot; check camera initialised in log (`Video recorder: OK`); check mosquitto radar bridge is running (`sudo journalctl -u mosquitto \| grep bridge`) |
| Pi5 not receiving ESP32-RADAR MQTT messages | Check mosquitto radar bridge: `sudo journalctl -u mosquitto \| grep -i bridge`. Bridge subscribes to `home/esp32/radar2/#` on VIP broker and republishes locally. If bridge is down, restart mosquitto on Pi5. |
| Pi5 not receiving relay/sensor ESP MQTT messages | Expected when Pi5 is BACKUP — `MQTT_HOST=localhost` means Pi5's mybot only processes ESP messages when Pi5 holds the VIP (ESPs connect to VIP broker). This is by design — no duplication between Pis. |
| App bulb shows permanent pending spinner when light triggered by motion or timer | `state` and `confirmed` out of sync — `_on_lobby_mqtt_state` / `_on_porch_mqtt_state` / `_on_lp_rly_mqtt_state` write both `confirmed` and `state` to Firebase; check that MQTT state callbacks are firing in the log |
| App shows orange / VIP unreachable after toggling local routing off then back on | `LocalApiServer` thread was blocked by a half-open TCP connection (Flutter app timed out at 2 s while the Pi's socket stayed open, causing `rfile.readline()` to block forever — accept queue fills, `/ping` never responds). Fixed in 2026-05-22: switched to `ThreadingHTTPServer`. If seen on older build, `sudo systemctl restart mybot.service` clears it immediately. |
| Duplicate door events in Firebase (`door_events` collection has two docs per open/close) | Pi5 reed switch callbacks were registered but GPIO 26 has no physical hardware — EMI from the 24 GHz radar triggered phantom events that published to `REED_DOOR/1` in parallel with Pi4. Fixed 2026-05-24: reed callbacks and `AwsIoTPublisher` disabled at startup on Pi5. |
| `mybot.service` stays inactive after reboot / Telegram bot silent after boot | Internet / DNS not ready when service started — check `After=network-online.target` is set in `mybot.service` (not `network.target`); also check `StartLimitIntervalSec` and `OnFailure` are in the `[Unit]` section; also check `main.py` init failure calls `sys.exit(1)` not a bare `return` so `Restart=on-failure` can re-trigger |
| `mybot.service` crash-looping | Check `logs/error_log.txt`; check GPIO conflicts; check sensor hardware connected |
| Scheduled timer not firing | Check `LightScheduler started` in log; verify `enabled=true` and valid HH:MM times in Firebase `/schedules/`; check Pi clock (`date` command) |
| Both Pi4 and Pi5 running but only one responds to light commands | Only the Pi holding the Keepalived VIP receives ESP MQTT connections — check `ip addr show wlan0 \| grep 192.168.1.100` on each Pi |
| Both Pis show as MASTER / split-brain (both have VIP `192.168.1.100`) | Usually caused by Pi5's wlan0 flapping ~4 s after keepalived starts — Pi5 misses Pi4's adverts and claims MASTER. Fixed by the `wait-for-wlan.conf` startup delay drop-in on Pi5. If it still occurs, run `makepi4master` to resolve manually. |
| keepalived `(HUB_IP) Entering FAULT STATE` / `Netlink reports wlan0 down` in logs | Pi5's wlan0 flapped during startup — suppressed by `wait-for-wlan.conf` startup delay. If it persists at runtime, check WiFi power save: `iwconfig wlan0 \| grep Power` — should say `Power Management:off`. |
| `advertisement interval mismatch` in keepalived logs | `advert_int` differs between Pi4 and Pi5 — must be identical (currently `2` on both). Check `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf` on both Pis. |

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-06-03 | Fix `mybot.service` not restarting after reboot when internet is not yet ready — (1) `After=network.target` → `After=network-online.target` so systemd waits for DNS before starting; (2) `StartLimitIntervalSec` + `OnFailure` moved from `[Service]` to `[Unit]` section where they are valid (were silently ignored before, so the 5-crash → reboot safety net was not working); (3) bare `return` on init failure replaced with `sys.exit(1)` so `Restart=on-failure` actually triggers when the service starts before internet is ready. Verified: full cold reboot with Pi4 as MASTER, Pi5 stays BACKUP — all services healthy after reboot. |
| 2026-06-03 | Add `RecordingResult.trigger` field (`"radar"`, `"local"`, `"manual"`) to `video_recorder.py` — `start_recording()` accepts `trigger` param; `_on_recording_complete` uses it to set a descriptive Telegram video caption (`"ESP32 Radar motion — 22s"` / `"Motion detected — Xs"` / `"Manual recording — Xs"`) instead of sending videos with no caption. |
| 2026-06-03 | Add mosquitto radar topic bridge on Pi5 (`/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/radar-bridge.conf`, `OS_Migration_PI5/configs/mosquitto-radar-bridge.conf`) — bridges `home/esp32/radar2/motion` and `home/esp32/radar2/availability` from VIP broker to Pi5's local mosquitto; Pi5's camera now records and sends radar-triggered video to Pi5's Telegram at all times, regardless of MASTER/BACKUP state. |
| 2026-06-03 | Decouple keepalived from mybot.service on both Pis — removed `vrrp_script check_mybot`, `track_script`, and all `notify_master/backup/fault` hooks; keepalived now manages only the VIP; `mybot.service` runs independently on both Pis under systemd; eliminates the circular dependency (keepalived restart → notify_backup stops mybot → check_mybot fails → Pi4 priority drops 101→81 → split-brain). |
| 2026-06-03 | Fix MQTT duplication — `MQTT_HOST` changed from `192.168.1.100` to `localhost` on both Pis; both Pis were previously connecting to the same VIP broker, subscribing to all ESP topics, and processing every message twice (duplicate Telegram alerts, duplicate Firebase writes); with localhost, only the MASTER Pi's mybot receives ESP messages. |
| 2026-06-03 | Fix keepalived split-brain on Pi5 startup — Pi5's wlan0 flaps ~4 s after boot (WiFi reassociation); Pi5 enters FAULT → BACKUP → MASTER in ~12 s before it can hear Pi4's adverts; fixed with systemd startup delay drop-in `/etc/systemd/system/keepalived.service.d/wait-for-wlan.conf` (waits for `192.168.1.108` on wlan0 then 5 s buffer); also increased `advert_int` 1 → 2 on both Pis to extend `master_down_interval` from ~3.6 s to ~6.6 s. |
| 2026-06-02 | Revert all MQTT brokers back to Keepalived VIP `192.168.1.100` — ESP32-RADAR firmware, ESP01-UL-RLY firmware, and Pi5 `mybot.service` `MQTT_HOST` all changed back from `192.168.1.108` to `192.168.1.100`; this ensures whichever Pi is MASTER handles all MQTT without any device needing reconfiguration on failover. Both devices OTA-flashed. |
| 2026-06-02 | Add "Two-Floor Sensor & Relay Assignment" section to README — documents that Pi4 (lower lobby, RASPI4-MAIN) has LD2420 wired directly on serial and controls ESP01-LL-RLY (`192.168.1.85`), while Pi5 (upper lobby, RASPI5-MAIN) receives radar motion from ESP32-RADAR over MQTT and controls ESP01-UL-RLY (`192.168.1.111`). |
| 2026-06-02 | Fix ESP32-RADAR motion not turning on lower-lobby light (ESP01-LL-RLY) — `_on_radar_motion()` only called `send_ul_relay(True)`; added `send_ll_relay(True)` (night only, respects 2-min manual-OFF override via `_living_room_manual_off_time`); added `_ll_light_off_timer` to turn LL-RLY OFF 5 min after motion stops, matching the existing UL-RLY behaviour. |
| 2026-06-02 | Fix `Restart=always` → `Restart=on-failure` in `mybot.service` on both Pi4 and Pi5 — `Restart=always` restarted mybot even after an explicit `systemctl stop`, fighting keepalived's `notify_backup`/`notify_fault` stop commands; each WiFi flap caused a rapid start/stop cycle that hit `StartLimitBurst=5` in under 5 minutes and triggered `OnFailure=systemd-reboot.service`; with `on-failure`, keepalived's explicit stops stick and only genuine crashes trigger auto-restart. |
| 2026-06-02 | Fix WiFi power management causing keepalived split-brain — `wlan0` sleep mode on both Pis caused periodic `wlan0 down` events; keepalived entered FAULT, fired `notify_fault` (stopped mybot), dropped priority, and both Pis ended up simultaneously MASTER with the VIP on both interfaces. Fixed by disabling WiFi power save permanently on both Pis via `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave-off.conf` (`wifi.powersave = 2`) + `nmcli con modify`. Split-brain resolved by restarting Pi5 keepalived so it cleanly re-enters BACKUP and yields to Pi4 (priority 101). |
| 2026-06-02 | Keepalived failover redesign — Pi4 is fixed MASTER (priority 101), Pi5 is BACKUP (priority 100); removed `nopreempt` from Pi5 so it preempts Pi4 when Pi4's priority drops to 81; added `notify_master`/`notify_backup` scripts on both Pis to auto-start/stop `mybot.service` on VIP gain/loss; only one bot runs at a time; Pi4 reclaims automatically when its mybot recovers. Tested end-to-end: failover in ~4 s, handback in ~7 s. |
| 2026-06-01 | Add `/test_cam` bot command — publishes `TRIGGER` to `home/esp32/radar2/cmd` via MQTT; ESP32-RADAR receives it, simulates motion ON for 5 s then OFF; Pi5 records video and sends MP4 to Telegram bot. Full chain test without needing physical motion. |
| 2026-06-01 | `mybot.service` `MQTT_HOST` env var changed from `192.168.1.100` (shared Keepalived VIP held by Pi4) to `192.168.1.108` (Pi5 direct IP). Pi5 was receiving no ESP32-RADAR MQTT messages because Pi4 holds the VIP and owns that broker. Pi5 is now always its own broker. |
| 2026-06-01 | Add `RecordingResult.manual` flag to `video_recorder.py` — manual recordings (`/record_video`, `/test_cam`) always send the MP4 to Telegram regardless of the `bot_video_enabled` toggle; motion-triggered recordings still respect the toggle. |
| 2026-06-01 | Add `/record_video <sec>` to Telegram command menu (`get_commands_list`); add `/record_video` to `/display_commands` help text. |
| 2026-06-01 | ESP32-RADAR motion now triggers Pi5 video recording and Telegram video send — `_on_radar_motion()` in `main.py` extended: `motion=ON` starts picamera2 recording (if video recording enabled via bot) and sends throttled Telegram text alert; `motion=OFF` schedules `_check_stop_recording` after `motion_timeout` delay via `_radar_rec_stop_timer`; `_on_recording_complete` sends the MP4 to Telegram. |
| 2026-05-24 | Disable reed switch callbacks and AWS IoT door publisher — Pi5 has no physical reed switch on GPIO 26; the pull-up pin was picking up EMI from the nearby 24 GHz radar, firing phantom door open/close events that published duplicate `REED_DOOR/1` MQTT messages to AWS IoT and created extra Firestore `door_events` documents alongside Pi4's writes. Reed callbacks and `AwsIoTPublisher` are now skipped at startup; `aws_door` remains `None` for the lifetime of the process. |
| 2026-05-22 | Sync with Pi4: add `aws_iot_publisher.py` (Pi5 variant — `RaspberryPi5-DoorPublisher`, cert path `/home/pi5/pi5_drive/Git_projects/RASPI5-MAIN/aws_certs`); wire into `main.py` door open/close callbacks and cleanup; fix `config.py` InfluxDB org/bucket `pi4org/pi4data` → `pi5org/pi5data`; fix `bot_commands.py` `read_reed_switch()` → `read_reed()` (method name was wrong — same bug fixed in Pi4 same day) |
| 2026-05-22 | Fix `LocalApiServer` hang — single-threaded `HTTPServer` blocked the entire accept loop when the Flutter app established a TCP connection but timed out mid-request (2 s client timeout left a half-open socket; Pi's `rfile.readline()` blocked indefinitely, filling the kernel accept queue; `/ping` appeared unreachable → app stayed orange even when Pi5 held the VRRP VIP). Fixed in `local_api_server.py` by replacing `HTTPServer` with `_ThreadingHTTPServer` (`ThreadingMixIn + HTTPServer`, `daemon_threads=True`). Same fix as RASPI4-MAIN commit `31fe337`. |
| 2026-05-20 | Fix motion auto-ON re-enable delay (2–4 min) after manually toggling a light from the app — `_living_room_manual_off_time` and `_porch_manual_off_time` were set on every manual OFF but never cleared when the user turned the light back ON; each OFF→ON→OFF cycle reset the timer to a fresh 2 minutes; fixed in `_execute_light_cmd` and `_execute_porch_cmd` by adding `elif cmd: _*_manual_off_time = 0` so an explicit ON immediately clears the override |
| 2026-05-18 | Fix light auto-toggle loop — when user manually turns OFF a porch or living-room light while motion is still active, the radar (`_on_radar_motion`) and LD2420 loop (`_trigger_light_control`) were immediately overriding the user's intent and turning it back ON; added `_porch_manual_off_time` and `_living_room_manual_off_time` timestamps recorded in `_execute_porch_cmd` / `_execute_light_cmd` on every manual OFF; both auto-ON paths check these timestamps and skip re-activation for 120 seconds after a manual OFF; normal automatic behaviour resumes after 2 minutes |
| 2026-05-18 | Add local HTTP API server (`local_api_server.py`, port 5757) — LAN fallback for light control when Firebase/internet is down; `PUT /lights/{id}` routes directly to relay execute methods; Pi deduplicates if both paths deliver |
| 2026-05-18 | Fix pending spinner on app bulb when light triggered by motion or scheduler — MQTT state callbacks now write both `lights/{id}/state` and `confirmed` to Firebase; `_last_*_cmd` dedup flag set before Firebase write to prevent SSE feedback loop |
